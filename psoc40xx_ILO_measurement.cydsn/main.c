/*******************************************************************************
* Project Name:      psoc40xx_ILO_measurement
* Device Used:       CY8C4014LQI-422 
* Software Used:     PSoC Creator 3.0 SP1
* Compiler Used:     ARM GCC 4.7.3 
* Related Hardware:  CY8CKIT-040 
********************************************************************************
* Theory of Operation:
*	Measures ILO against internal main oscillator by using Systick (clocked from CPU clock)
*	and the watchdog timer (clocked from the ILO). The demo project calls the routine
*	and prints out the return value (ILO freq in kHz) in hex. It also sets up a WDT interrupt
*	to wake the processor from deep sleep on a fixed interval. The interval uses the
*	measured ILO frequency to set its accuracy. Probing R30 on the KIT-040 will allow
*	oscilloscope/frequency counter measurement of the resulting accuracy.
